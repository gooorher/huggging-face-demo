"I'm Juanlu, a Telematics Engineering student at the University of Malaga, currently pursuing a Master's in Big Data and Artificial Intelligence. 

My professional background includes working as a cashier at Banco Santander, where I developed customer service and financial management skills. 

Academically, I focus on programming, networks, databases, and the use of LLM for artificial intelligence procedures. I'm passionate about the intersection of technology and finance. 

Additionally, I spent a year on exchange at UPB (Politehnica University of Bucharest).

Since I was young, I have competed in many sports: tennis, handball, paddle, and soccer (the latter two being the ones I still compete in), so I have a strong understanding of the importance of teamwork and striving to achieve everything I set my mind to."," Juanlu is a Telematics Engineering student at the University of Malaga .
